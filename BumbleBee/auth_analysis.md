## Important Note
To identify the actual username, you would need to:
1. Check the phpBB database backup that was downloaded (/store/backup_1682506471_dcsr71p7fyijoyq8.sql.gz)
2. Look at the admin logs in the phpBB admin panel
3. Cross-reference the session IDs with user accounts in the database

The most relevant database backup file that might contain this information:
`/store/backup_1682506471_dcsr71p7fyijoyq8.sql.gz` (Size: 71,680 bytes)

Note: The size was calculated by looking at the response size in the Apache access logs when the backup file was downloaded. This information would be visible in the 'bytes sent' field of the log entry for this file download.
